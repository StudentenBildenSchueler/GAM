## Rationale

As our chapter count grows, so does the size of our [Google Workspace](https://workspace.google.com). With active accounts soon to reach 200, it's becoming increasingly important to automate account creation, group memberships, profile information, email signatures, etc.

GAM is a powerful command line interface (CLI) with comprehensive batch operations for all manner of Google Workspace functionality. It's available at <https://github.com/jay0lee/gam>.
