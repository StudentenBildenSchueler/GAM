# Gmail Signatures

`board.html` contains the email signature template for our board member accounts (<firstname>.<lastname>@studenten-bilden-schueler.de) and `chapters.html` the one for our chapter accounts (<info|studenten|schueler>.<cityname>@studenten-bilden-schueler.de).

> **Warning**: Do not rename the `gmail/images` folder as that will break the image links in all our emails!
